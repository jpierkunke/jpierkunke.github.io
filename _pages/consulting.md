## Tribal environmental professionals

I have had the pleasure of working with Tribal environmental professionals since 2020 when I first co-instructed a Data Carpentries workshop on R, hosted by The [Tribal Exchange Network Group (TXG)](https://www.tribalexchangenetwork.org/) and their current [Vice Chair, Angie Reed](https://www.tribalexchangenetwork.org/angie-reed) (Water Resources Planner for [Penobscot Indian Nation](https://www.penobscotnation.org/departments/department-of-natural-resources/water-n%c9%99pi-resources/)) and facilitated by [Northern Arizona University's Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP)](https://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/Home/). We have since collaborated to develop workshop curriculum materials that are more closely adapted to the Tribes' goals, data, and workflow. I also contribute to the consulting services and Data Drop-in Sessions that TXG offers.
