## For MSU students

[GradCat 360](https://www.montana.edu/gradschool/professionaldevelopment/index.html)

## Things I've made

[Math fundamentals for measure theory students](https://github.com/jpierkunke/measure_theory_notes/tree/main): this is a brief set of notes I put together.

[Hour tracking Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1olA00I37ls_eq4pDLYbfgsuS4Tw7m72hci8yNNqaf4A/edit?usp=sharing): I used this in graduate school to keep track of how much time I was spending on different projects/priorities, and some other students have requested it and found it helpful, so I've made a template version on Google Sheets that you can copy to your own Google Drive and edit for yourself.
