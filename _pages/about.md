Welcome!  My name is Jess Kunke and I am thrilled to be an assistant professor of statistics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana.  I completed my Ph.D. in statistics at the University of Washington in Seattle, advised by [Tyler H. McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/).

My research interests are in survey methods, network models, and spatiotemporal processes with environmental and social applications.  I am passionate about teaching, consulting, and mentoring, and I collaborate with the Tribal Exchange Network to provide consulting to Tribal environmental professionals.

Outside my statistical work, I enjoy running, being in nature, finding [slugs](https://www.nps.gov/olym/learn/nature/slugs.htm) and giant leaves, eating good food, making things with yarn, and playing the piano.
