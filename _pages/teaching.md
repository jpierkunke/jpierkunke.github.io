I love working with students and I find teaching rewarding. Over the years, I have taught STEM classes at the middle school through undergraduate levels, served as teaching assistant for several graduate-level courses across departments, and instructed coding workshops within and outside academia. In all of these roles, I have written new curriculum materials and developed upon those materials I inherited from previous instructors.

I like to use [backward design](https://tll.mit.edu/teaching-resources/course-design/backward-design/) for overall course structure and individual lectures, and I am grateful to past mentors who introduced me to it. First I identify the key skills or concepts I want students to develop based on the curriculum objectives. Then I design or adapt the activities, content delivery, formative and summative assessments to achieve those objectives. By now I have had a fair amount of practice with this approach, and I continue to refine these methods and seek feedback.

One of my key roles is to help students become more self-directed learners, which will serve them well whether they pursue graduate school or begin another job. I respond to students' questions with my own to help them break down their questions into steps; if students tell me "I donâ€™t understand X", I ask them to talk me through what parts they understand and where they are stuck. I tell students the intention behind my questions, pointing out that they are successfully resolving them on their own with some guidance from me. Lectures are interactive with multiple problems for students to solve. I check in frequently with specific questions to assess understanding, rather than asking only yes/no or open-ended questions.
