# About me

Welcome!  My name is Jess Kunke and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington in Seattle, advised by Tyler H. McCormick.  My research interests are in survey methods, network models, and spatiotemporal processes with environmental and social applications.  I am passionate about teaching, consulting, and mentoring.  Outside my statistical work, I enjoy running, being in nature, finding giant slugs and leaves, eating good food, making things with yarn, and playing the piano.
