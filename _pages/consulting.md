## Tribal environmental professionals
I have had the pleasure of working with tribal environmental professionals since 2020 through [Northern Arizona University's Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP)](https://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/Home/). Initially introduced to them by co-instructing a Data Carpentries workshop with them on R for ecologists, we have since worked together to develop workshops and consulting support of our own. Through them, I have been working with [Angie Reed](https://www.tribalexchangenetwork.org/angie-reed) and the [Tribal Exchange Network](https://www.tribalexchangenetwork.org/) to provide consulting service, drop-in hours, workshop curriculum development and instruction.

## Other consulting experience

- Graduate Student Consultant (awarded Senior Consultant), four projects, [University of Chicago Statistics Consulting Program](https://stat.uchicago.edu/about/consulting/)
